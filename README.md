The project is about dental tooth classification for old and teen. 
The requirements.txt folder lists all the dependencies and libraries used in the model. The tuning has been done using 5 apochs per step
Done crossvalidation using loss function.
Conv2D model is used to make the pattern of each class visible.
The base model is made using Tensorflow Keras.
The model is normalize to get the better results.
Last have used some Hyperperameters to make the model learn well.
